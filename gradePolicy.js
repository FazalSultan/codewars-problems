Any  less than  is a failing grade.
Sam is a professor at the university and likes to round each student's  according to these rules:

If the difference between the  and the next multiple of  is less than , round  up to the next multiple of .
If the value of  is less than , no rounding occurs as the result will still be a failing grade.
Examples

 round to  (85 - 84 is less than 3)
 do not round (result is less than 40)
 do not round (60 - 57 is 3 or higher)
Given the initial value of  for each of Sam's  students, write code to automate the rounding process.
